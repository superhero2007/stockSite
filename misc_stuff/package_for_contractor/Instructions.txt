1) I am using the template bootstrap4.html that I bought from the wrapbootstap. You can see it working at: http://wrapbootstrap.com/preview/WB0R5L90S
2) Working off of the template above, the rough layout I want is in strategy1_ticker.html
3) In strategy1_ticker, I would like to display the data from ticker_data.csv in the table that's already been set up at the bottom. 
   I would like this table to look much cleaner and smaller so that more can be fit at one time on the page. 
4) In strategy1_ticker, I would like to display the 'adj_close' column in stock price data in stock_price.csv on a line chart.
5) Here is the part that needs some coding:
   * I would like to display markers on the chart based on data in the table. 
   * I would like to display these markers based on a user specified threshold on column 'Percent 1'. Default should be 0.7
   * The logic would be if the Percent1 column is greater than the threshold, then display a green upward facing triagle if
     Text4 says 'LONG' or a red downward facing triangle if 'Text4' says short on the line graph on the date 'Date 1'
   * If a user clicks on a triangle on the graph, the page should jump to the respective entry in the table
6) On the table, I would like to make the export, filter columns, refresh and search features operational
